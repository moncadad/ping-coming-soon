## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Had a lot of fun breaking down the steps when testing the email matched the desired format. Once I had the challenge figured out, visually representing it was next. It was fun tying in each "error" visually. Ultimately I just enjoyed seeing it come to life. Another thing, I also figured it be a nice point in my journey to utilize scss more, so I did that.
In no way I plan to know it all by heart I'll be leaving helpful links below.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue using tools that will help in the future such as more SCSS and all I have to learn of it. A well as more languages and frameworks.
Another thing simply better implementation of JS I think I do fine but I know I can always aim for better.
